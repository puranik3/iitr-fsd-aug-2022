## Questions
- Meta introduced it
- React - A frontend library
    - Angular, Vue
- React vs Angular
    - React gives you things to define and create the UI
    - Angular gives lots of other things - Router, Form validations, backend communications
- React introduced the concept of a Virtual DOM
    - speeds up DOM updates
- Why frontend library like React?
    - DOM updates are faster
        - DOM updates are managed by the library
        - DOM updates are managed efficiently
        - Page refreshes are faster
    - Component-based architecture
        - A component is a small piece of UI
            - A component manages the HTML, CSS, JS for that piece of the UI
        - You put together smaller components to build larger components / pages
        - Components are building blocks for your pages, and ultimately your application
        - They are essentially like custom HTML element. Would it not be nice if you could create
            - <TopNavigation links="[]">
            - <IconButton icon="code" text="Code" />
